              <p class="flow-text old-text">The Raffles Institution Computer Science Club was founded in 1823 and is, despite being one of the most fascinating, one of the least understood CCAs in the school. The CCA is in fact an underground organisation that promotes a thorough and rigorous understanding of black magic and its practical applications in everyday life. This short write-up seeks to clear misconceptions about the club and give a brief overview of what it aims to achieve and what each mystical session is like.</p>

                    <h4>Etymology</h4>
                    <p class="flow-text">The Raffles Council of Sorcery and the Cosmos (RCSC) gets its name from a magical box first invented by The Right Honourable Grandmaster Wizard Sir Randolf the Fabulous, a pioneering wizard and one of the most controversial practitioners of black magic to ever walk this earth.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <p class="flow-text">Commonfolk understand little about these magical boxes, often going to extensive lengths to avoid interacting directly with them. For example, some resort to making use of prefabricated automagical blogging platforms such as WordPress, Joomla and Ghost to stay away from the InterWeb Magic known as the Holy Tempest of Mystic Light (HTML).</p>

            <div class="container">
              <p class="flow-text">Despite making use of the enchantments laid upon their portable magical boxes on a daily basis, few can be said to have more than a cursory understanding of the darker and deeper works behind these spells. Many an unwise wizard or witch have sadly fallen prey to the Abyss of Four-O-Four and become separated from the InterWeb pipes that bind our magical community together.</p>

              <h4>Sessions</h4>
              <p class="flow-text">The average session is split into 2 sections: “design” and “programming”. The former seeks to find ways to use magic boxes to create digital art. On the other hand, the latter seeks to fully understand and build on the magic boxes themselves.</p>

              <h4>Mandatory Warnings</h4>
              <p class="flow-text">As with any CCA as intense as this, there are inherent dangers. It is not uncommon for members to find themselves uncontrollably addicted to games that they themselves made. In such situations, trained personnel administer electroshock therapy and employ a bouncer to physically separate the offending member from his/her magic box.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <p class="flow-text">Another serious threat is that of electrocution. These magic boxes are powered by magical energy that flows in our walls. This magical energy is unfortunately unsafe for commonfolk and wizards alike. Due to the high density of magic boxes, members may find themselves jolted by 240V RMS AC.</p>
